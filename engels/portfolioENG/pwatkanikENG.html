                        <li>
                            <b>Java</b>: As TILE - student, I've pursued 2 courses involving the programming language Java. The first course was a in - depth introduction to
                            programming, in particular, the Java language. The second course was an extension to that first course in which we learned about more complex data structures
                            and user interface programming. In another course, I've had the chance to learn more about programming design patterns, giving me an insight in efficient
                            programming techniques.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>HTML5 & CSS3</b>: Web technologies are an important part of the programmer's skills and I've mastered the basics of HTML5 and CSS3. I am currently following
                            a course where we learn more about JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax and JSON.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>mySQL en database design</b> I am currently engaged in a project where we have to make an application that is running on a database. This experience has greatly enhanced
                            my knowledge of mySQL and relational database design.

                        <li>
                            <b>Design and Analysis</b>: This field of study is becoming increasingly more important in the skillset of future programmers. A well thought - out design forms a strong 
                            foundation to build software. As businesses and IT need to understand each other, these skills are now considered essential
